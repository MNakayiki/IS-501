                        <p>I was born and raised in small remote town called Kireka, Uganda. During my childhood, I had the chance of forming an unbreakable bond with my parents, but most especially with my father who later passed away in 2001. My father was a firm believer in education and serving the community through doing community services. To him, this was the most important tool for success and a happy life. Even after his death, my mother continued doing my father’s community services and she always involved me in these duties. We always went out to clean city centers, wash for the elderly, visit orphanages, and the sick people in our local clinics. As a child, these services gave me a direct sense of direction about the kind of career that I want to pursue. I knew that I needed to serve the community through doing public services. By the time I completed my secondary studies in 2013, I had already planned to attend university and my desire was to study abroad particularly in the United States. Gaining an education in a foreign country is a great achievement where I come from. Therefore, I knew that I needed to set my goals, and also exercise great faith in Heavenly Father in order to make my plan possible. Even though my mother was willing to sponsor me to the highest level of my education, I had to make a sacrifice of letting her meet my younger siblings’ academic needs first. Therefore, I decided to improvise other means of meeting my academic needs. <br><br>  In order to find a way forward, in 2015, I found an institute in town (Kampala), and I pursued my first diploma in Tours and Travel, and with a certificate in the International Air and Transport Association. This course enabled me to visit different parts of Uganda and I was able to witness the terrible living conditions people lived in. It was right at that moment I knew that I could be the change that I want to see in my country. I managed to get my first job as a travel consultant and I worked up to 20hrs/week. I knew that I needed to find other jobs that would increase my income since I needed to fulfill my desire of attending college in the United States. Therefore, despite the unfavorable working conditions, I took up two other jobs that enabled me to save up to almost six thousand dollars by the end of 2017. This whole situation shaped me into being the more determined, hard-working, patient, and confident young woman that I am today. <br><br> Attending school at Brigham Young University-Idaho (BYU-I)and gaining an education in Sociology helped me acquire a lot of knowledge about how human societies operate and what impacts social relationships in our communities. Through various courses such as Research Methods, Social Science Statics, Sociological Analysis, and Advanced Writing and Research, I have learned different sociological approaches to the dilemma of power, economic and status differentiations in American society. In addition, I also learned to recognize strong arguments, uncover assumptions, evaluate evidence, recognize rhetorical patterns, and infer ideas from data through conducting research. <br><br> AT BYU-I, I actively participated in campus voluntary services such as being an Education Week Facilitator, a Sociology Society Service Coordinator, Autism Mentoring Representative, and also a Herber J. Grant Mentoring Representative. These services enabled me to offer one-on-one peer mentoring to new and returning students which increased their academic performances. Besides that, I helped mentees overcome social anxiety through coaching and creating social experiments. Being able to provide voluntary services to my fellow students and also on top of that maintain a great GPA strengthened my mentoring, leadership, and academic skills. <br><br> In addition, I also worked as a voluntary intern in the summer (2021) at the Family Crisis center and it was a great opportunity for me to get practical knowledge about the kind of service this Non-Profit offers. As an intern, I worked at the Food Bank, Thrift Store, attended to clients while answering to their questions regarding the services we offered, got to know each advocate and why they do their specific work including how they coped with stress. I was able to finish my tasks within a period of seven weeks mainly with the help of my coordinator and other staff members. The skill of questioning helped me understand that it helps the learner to demonstrate curiosity and also engage in the process of learning by identifying relevant issues. <br><br> Over the years, class preparedness has taught me how to prioritize, work best under pressure, and also exercise good collaboration teamwork skills. Throughout my internship, I was also able to apply the same skills through setting goals on what specific tasks I needed to accomplish per day. Being able to get things done right on time helped me earn credibility and trust from my coordinator and this is the same exact reason why one of the advocates who was in charge of the sexual assault group invited me to join her group. By the end of my internship, my teamwork, organizational, and prioritizing skills had highly improved. <br><br> I am pursuing a Masters of Public Administration (MPA) with an emphasis in Nonprofit and Program Management because I am passionate about committing to a career that would provide me with the opportunity to make a change in peoples’ lives. In the future and after gaining all the necessary education including the hand-on experience here in the United States, I look forward to starting up a Nonprofit Organization that would be give back to the Ugandan community. I am planning that this organization will mainly target people that are living in the rural areas of Uganda, and I am hoping to start off with public charities. I have witnessed the power of giving back to our communities and working for the well-being of our own people. Therefore, I am positive that the additional resources and training BYU professors offer will help me tremendously excel as a great program manager and an owner of a recognized Nonprofit organization.  <br><br> I have come a long way since my father passed away, therefore, I clearly understand what it means to achieve success through persistence and resilience. This is the attitude I will bring to the school and my team. As an international student who successfully integrated into the American culture, I see myself quickly contributing to my team by helping those who might struggle to do the same. </p>
